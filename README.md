# About this Project

These are coding experiments meant to explore concurrent programming, design patterns, languages, and more.

Have fun. ðŸ˜Š

# Getting started

There's a README in each sub-project.

I mostly use Visual Studio Community Edition for the C# and WPF/XAML development and Visual Studio Code for the Python portions.

To install tools on Windows:

* `winget install -e --moniker git`
* `winget install -e --moniker vs2022-community`
* `winget install -e --moniker vscode`
